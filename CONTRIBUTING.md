## Contribution Process

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

VibeTensor requires the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) process to be followed for all contributions.

The DCO is a lightweight way for contributors to certify that they wrote or otherwise have the right to submit the code they are contributing. The full text of the DCO can be found at [https://developercertificate.org/](https://developercertificate.org/).

### DCO Sign-Off

All commits must be signed off by the contributor, certifying that you have the right to submit your contribution under the project's license.

To sign off a commit, add a `Signed-off-by` line to your commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

You can do this automatically by using the `-s` or `--signoff` flag when committing:

```bash
git commit -s -m "Your commit message"
```
